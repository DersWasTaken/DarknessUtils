# DarknessUtils

DarknessUtils is a mod developed by Der_s for the autcraft server. This mod tries to implement QOL improvements for AC players during darkness fights.
Currently the only feature is highlighting boss mobs during darkness fights, but there is more to come!

Known Bugs:

"Blinking" when highlighted boss mob is spawned. This is due to a issue with glowlib, which the mod is currently using to make entities glow. This will be replaced soon.
